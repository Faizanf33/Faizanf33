### 👋 Hi, I’m Faizan Ahmad
👀 I’m interested in full-stack development related projects, having an experience of **5+ years**, 
working on different languages including **Python**, **Java**, **C/C++** and frameworks like **Django** and **Flask** (recent).
🌱 I’m currently learning **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Next.js** and **Vue.js** 
as I have sound knowledge and experience of pure html, javascript and css along with **bootstrap** and **material design (mdl)**. 
I'm also hoping to start working on **React Native** asap.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to my area of interests so I might be able to facilitate someone or a team with the skillset I possess.
